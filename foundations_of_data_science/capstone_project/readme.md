#### Capstone Project Overview

1. What is the problem you want to solve?

  There has been a shift from traditional credit sources like banks to microlending or microcredit institutions especialy among individuals who find it hard to access bank loan facilities and small businesses. This category opts to find loans from such institutions to help them with their cash needs.

  My project has the following goals:
    a) For borrowers/Loanees: Predict how much loan amount their application may attract and optimize their loan application.
    b) For Providers: Discover insights in data that will help them understand their customers better and create a good customer experience for them

2. Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t otherwise?

  Gowee Inc, my client, is a player in the microcredit industry. They wish to be able to aptly advice their clients when they apply for loans by predicting possible loan amounts they could get based on historical data. In other words, help their clients make good loan applications. They also seek to look at the data and discover any insights that will help them understand their client much better and perhaps enhance their customer experience.

3. What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?

  I intend to use data from kiva.org accessible via their open api.

4. In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).

  * Acquire data
    - Script to connect to Api and pull data
  * Data cleaning
    - Check missing data.
    - Check data inconsistencies that may be generalized e.g business types
  * Data analysis
    - Check variables in the data set
    - Inspect for relationships between variables
    - Visualize the data
    - Pick most important variables that will help answer the problem(s)
  * Prediction
    - Train models for prediction
    - Check for models accuracies and choose the best one

5. What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or slide deck.
  
  * Code - R notebook
  * Presentation - slide deck
